# SHOP FUN

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer. This project is a full stack e-commerce site, with the backend configured with a working Express.js API to use mongoose to interact with a mongodb database and stripe api for payment, with the client side being on react. The site is fully deployed on Heroku.
